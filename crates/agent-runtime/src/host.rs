//! Host interfaces the agent runtime is composed from.
//!
//! The runtime owns ACP session semantics; everything that depends on where it runs — how session
//! rows are stored, how an agent plugin process is reached, which MCP servers a session receives,
//! who hears about lifecycle events, and which directory a Workspace maps to — is supplied by the
//! host through these traits. Desktop implements them over SQLite and its plugin API; a sandbox
//! Node implements them over its own ledger and plugin lifecycle.
