# Subagent Details

English | [中文](subagent-details.zh.md)

The parent conversation can show read-only OpenCode child-session cards. Expand a card to inspect
its text, thoughts, plans and tool input/output; nested cards follow the explicit parent relationship.
Parent replies remain in the ordinary timeline. The original Stop action controls the parent prompt;
these cards do not add child cancellation, steering or closing.

Child state is unreported while its parent is still observed, unless a supported report establishes it.
After a parent completion, failure or cancellation, the card shows **Delegation returned** only when the
latest delegation call in the same parent turn and source stream names this child in
`rawOutput.metadata.sessionID`, reports ACP `completed`, and carries the provider's `status` of
`completed`. Every other case shows **Further state unknown (projection stopped)**: an unfinished,
failed, cancelled or background `status=running` delegation, or no associable session id. The latest
call is chosen by persisted position, so a later turn continuing the same child session never revises
an earlier turn. Both labels describe a returned foreground result or missing subsequent observations,
never a completed, cancelled or stopped child; live, warm and cold replay derive the same label from the
same persisted facts. Historical EOF without a recorded turn fence remains unknown instead of inventing
that ending. An unfinished child tool displays an unknown outcome when the parent turn ends. Missing or
cyclic relationships remain independent readable cards and never claim a delegation result.

Attribution comes from `_meta["opencode/child-session"]`, never from a tool title, ID prefix, or depth
alone. Unsupported or malformed sources remain in the parent timeline. Complete metadata and text
annotations are retained during live batching and replay; distinct sources cannot merge on colliding
or missing message IDs. Incremental tool metadata replaces supplied top-level namespaces, including
explicit null, without recursively patching unknown provider objects.

The [history owner](session-history.md) must persist the source metadata. This UI cannot recover
attribution omitted from older files, and ordinary OpenCode projection may stop when the parent prompt
ends. Cards therefore state that only received content is available and do not promise complete
background history. Live observation diagnostics and historical content are separate concerns.
